          <h2>Jake Lee — The Comeback Runner</h2>
          <p>Running was once a part of who I was. But after a severe ankle injury and months of rehab, I felt lost. Watching others improve while I feared re-injury was tough.
          </p>
          <p>I found RunInSight during my lowest. I began with small walks, mood tracking, and injury-safe strength training. The platform helped me rebuild trust in my body and reset my mindset.
          </p>
          <p>Eventually, I progressed from 2K to 5K runs, and recently completed my first 8K in two years. I'm not chasing speed anymore. I'm chasing longevity and peace with my running identity.

          <h2>Emily Rose — From Casual to Competitive</h2>
          <p>I downloaded RunInSight to help with weight loss and stay active. At first, it was just an app — but it quickly became my coach, motivator, and tracker.
          </p>
          <p>Heart rate tracking, energy logging, and recovery insights showed me patterns. I learned to listen to my body. On good energy days, I pushed. On fatigue days, I rested guilt-free.
          </p>
          <p>I joined my first Parkrun within three months. Now, I’m training for a half-marathon. RunInSight made me believe in my own rhythm and strength. It’s not just about running. It’s about growth.

          <h2>Sofia Patel — Running Through the Seasons</h2>
          <p>For me, running is therapy. I started with 1K jogs just to get fresh air after stressful workdays. But I wasn’t improving — I kept hitting walls.
          </p>
          <p>RunInSight changed that. By logging not only runs but my mental state, hydration, and stress levels, I realized how much external factors affected my performance.
          </p>
          <p>Seasonal affective dips, hormonal shifts, even skipped meals — the platform helped me understand and adapt. I now run 4 days a week and my winter blues are so much lighter.

          <h2>Marcus Nguyen — The Night Runner</h2>
          <p>With a hectic job and two kids, I can only run after 9pm. It used to feel unsafe, rushed, and lonely.
          </p>
          <p>RunInSight helped me feel part of a community even during solo runs. I log my feelings, track my effort, and reflect. The night becomes my reset button, not a burden.
          </p>
          <p>I also learned about proper fueling and rest, even for nighttime runners. I now look forward to these peaceful runs under streetlights. They’re mine.
