          <h1>Run Smart: Foundations of Form, Breathing, and Posture</h1>
          <img src="../static/img/homepage/course-2.png" alt="Form and Breathing">
          <p>This course is all about quality over quantity. Running efficiently means fewer injuries, better endurance, and a more enjoyable experience. We’ll break down common mistakes runners make — from heel-striking too hard to poor posture that saps energy — and show you exactly how to fix them.</p>
          <p>You’ll get visual breakdowns of elite-level running form, posture drills you can do at home, and practice plans to help you implement what you learn. Breathing techniques like box breathing and rhythmic coordination are covered in-depth to help you avoid cramps and oxygen debt.</p>
          <p>Whether you’re training for a 5K or simply want to feel lighter and stronger during runs, this course will transform how you move. Every week ends with a mini-challenge to test and reflect on your progress.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Video breakdown of proper footstrike, arm swing, and head alignment.</li>
            <li>Breathing strategies (box breathing, rhythmic breathing) for endurance.</li>

          <h1>Mind & Motion: Preparing Your Body and Mind for the Road Ahead</h1>
          <img src="../static/img/homepage/course-3.png" alt="Mental Preparation">
          <p>This course addresses the mental and emotional side of running — often the hidden key to long-term consistency. You’ll learn to spot emotional fatigue, develop self-awareness, and build a running routine that works with your life, not against it.</p>
          <p>Through daily mindset prompts, sleep and stress tracking, and guided reflection tools, you’ll become attuned to the signals your body and brain are sending. You’ll explore strategies for handling low-motivation days, building confidence, and mentally preparing for races or long runs.</p>
          <p>We also dive into community connection: how mentorship, support groups, and shared milestones can boost morale and make running feel less lonely. By the end, you won’t just be physically stronger — you’ll be more resilient, mindful, and motivated than ever.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Daily mindset journals and check-ins.</li>
