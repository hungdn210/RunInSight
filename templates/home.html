                <h3>Jake Lee — The Comeback Runner</h3>
                <p>
                  “Running was once a part of who I was. But after a severe ankle injury and months of rehab, I felt lost. I’d scroll social media watching others improve while I feared every step would lead to re-injury. 
                  <br><br>
                  Then I found RunInSight. I started slow — tracking how I felt, logging short walks, and using the strength training recommendations to rebuild confidence. The mood and energy logging helped me become kinder to myself, recognizing that healing isn’t just physical. 
                  <br><br>
                  Slowly, I returned to 2K runs, then 5Ks. Last week, I hit 8K for the first time in two years. I’m not chasing speed anymore — I’m chasing sustainability. And RunInSight is my daily coach, quietly guiding me with insights I didn’t know I needed.”

                <h3>Emily Rose — From Casual to Competitive</h3>
                <p>
                  “When I first downloaded RunInSight, I just wanted to lose some weight and run a few times a week. But then I started exploring the app: tracking heart rate zones, monitoring my recovery, and seeing how my mood affected performance. 
                  <br><br>
                  I discovered patterns. On days I logged better sleep and high energy, my pace improved. On days I pushed too hard back-to-back, the app gently flagged increased injury risk. It was like having a silent mentor who actually knew my habits. 
                  <br><br>
                  Within 3 months, I joined my first Parkrun. Now, I’m training for a half-marathon — something I never dreamed of before. This isn’t just an app. It’s a mindset shift. It helped me take running seriously, on my own terms.”
